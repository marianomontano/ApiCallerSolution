# ApiCallerSolution
Api call manager designed to perform HttpRequests to API endpoints.
So far it allows making GET, POST, PUT and DELETE methods, passing parameters in the URL (GET) or in the body (POST and PUT), Headers including Authentication Bearer Token.
I'm still working on different types of authentication and more Http methods.
